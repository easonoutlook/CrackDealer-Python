#CrackDealer Python Alpha 0.1

##Description:
Python Script to upload and get info from iPA. It allows submission to AppAddict and iPhonecake. Whilst uploading to datafilehost, filepup or your own choice. This is in alpha with only basic testing. I have only used this on a Raspberry Pi running Debian 6. 

##Usage:

python2 main.py "<IPANAME>"
for JUST INFO on the iPA use -info on the end like so:

python2 main.py "<IPANAME>" -info

##Requirements:
I have tested this on python 2 and am yet to convert to python 3. The following modules used are:
plistlib
zipfile       Default
os            Default
sys           Default
string       Default
requests
json         Default
getpass   Default

Some come by default others don't. For missing modules run:
